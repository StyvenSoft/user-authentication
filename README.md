# user-authentication

In this project, I am setting up a basic template to work with user authentication on the MERN stack. Learn how to register user accounts in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/es) database, log in to users in the react interface, and verify registered users. Using react hooks and the context API to handle user authentication state management in the interface created with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).
